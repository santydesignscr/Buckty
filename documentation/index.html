                    <h3 id="apis">Api introductions (Important):</h3>
                    <p>Below is the api list used inside buckty's base system.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Google plus api & Google drive api</li>
                        <li>Dropbox api</li>
                        <li>Twitter api</li>

                        <li>Pexels api</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <b>Api Notice:</b> It's important that you read this part of documentation. Dropbox api requires your site to use ssl protocols (https), else you can't use their api and it will result into an error or you can disable it from backend to avoid errors. We highly recommend you to use <b>HTTPS</b> as it secures the credentails of users and you have alot of other advantages. if you want to use free ssl cloud service we recommend you to use <b><a href="http://www.cloudflare.com/" target="_blank">cloudflare.com</a></b> Cloudflare provides you free to use secure ssl service and also cdn hosting network <b>But it's file upload is limited to 100mb</b>. if you don't want to use https then you have to <b>Disable dropbox api</b>, as it will not work without having https. You can use <b>Google drive</b> api without https (but still https is recommended).
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
                    <p>
                        Connect to your server and upload all the files from folder <b>Buckty pack</b> to your server 's root folder or any sub folder where you want to install the buckty.
                        <br>
                        <br> Now if you visit your site link where you have uploaded buckty , you will see <b>Installation directory is present</b>, so it says all , you have to go to the installation path to install buckty , so do it by going to :
                        <br>
                        <code><b>http://yoursite.com/install</b></code>
                        <br> Now you will see a bit of information before proceeding to installation.
                        <br>
